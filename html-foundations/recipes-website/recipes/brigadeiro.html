    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brigadeiro is the quintessential Brazilian party sweet, a simple yet irresistible fudge truffle made with just a few ingredients. Its rich, chocolatey flavor and melt-in-your-mouth texture make it a universal favorite.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cocoa powder, sifted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus more for rolling</li>
        <li>Chocolate sprinkles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the condensed milk, cocoa powder, and butter.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for about 10-15 minutes until the mixture thickens and pulls away from the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Pour onto a greased plate and let it cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once cool, grease your hands with a little butter, roll the mixture into small balls, and coat them generously in chocolate sprinkles.</li>
    </ol>
