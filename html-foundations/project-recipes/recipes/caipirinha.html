    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Caipirinha is Brazil's most famous and refreshing cocktail, a perfect balance of strong, sweet, and sour. Made with just three ingredients—cachaça, lime, and sugar—it's a vibrant and potent drink that embodies the lively spirit of Brazilian culture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large lime, washed well</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 oz (60 ml) cachaça</li>
        <li>Ice cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the lime into small wedges, removing the central white pith if desired to reduce bitterness.</li>
        <li>Place the lime wedges and sugar in a sturdy old-fashioned glass.</li>
        <li>Muddle firmly to crush the lime and release all its juice.</li>
        <li>Fill the glass with ice cubes. Pour the cachaça over the ice, stir well to combine everything, and enjoy immediately.</li>
    </ol>
